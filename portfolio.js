        titulo : "Echo - Unity Game",
        descricao : "Echo is a prototype horror game in development, created with Unity, that aims to provide an accessible gaming experience for blind people. The project was born from the desire to create a game where the lack of vision is not an obstacle to having fun and being scared and was inspired by a blind colleague at UFRPE. To achieve this, I am exploring game design techniques focused on audio and an accessible interface, to create an experience similar to horror games from the 5th generation of consoles for blind people.",

        descricao : "The paper explores the use of Communities of Practice (CoPs) to scale agile methods in large software development projects. Through a Systematic Literature Mapping (SLM), the study found that CoPs can be effective in promoting coordination between teams, knowledge sharing, and an open community culture. These factors are crucial for successful agile adoption in large-scale projects. This paper was written during a scientific initiation project with Marcelo Marinho from UFRPE.",
