        descricao : "Echo is a prototype horror game in development, created with Unity, that aims to provide an accessible gaming experience for blind people. The project was born from the desire to create a game where the lack of vision is not an obstacle to having fun and being scared and was inspired by a blind colleague at UFRPE. To achieve this, I am exploring game design techniques focused on audio and an accessible interface, to create an experience similar to horror games from the 5th generation of consoles for blind people.",
