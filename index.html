                <h3>Computer science student | Software tester | Developer</h3>
    
                <p>Growing up, I was always curious about how things worked, leading me to pursue a passion for science and technology. Now, I'm a Computer Science student and researcher at UFRPE.</p>
    
                <p>With 2 years of experience in manual testing, I've honed my skills in test automation using Cypress and creating reports, metrics, and quality indicators.</p>
    
                <p>Proficient in C and C++, I'm currently diving into front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my free time, I enjoy developing games in Unity.</p>

                <p class="descricao-meta">Echo is a prototype horror game in development, created with Unity, that aims to provide an accessible gaming experience for blind people. The project was born from the desire to create a game where the lack of vision is not an obstacle to having fun and being scared and was inspired by a blind colleague at UFRPE. To achieve this, I am exploring game design techniques focused on audio and an accessible interface, to create an experience similar to horror games from the 5th generation of consoles for blind people.</p>
